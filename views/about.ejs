    <h2>About Our Mission</h2>
    <p>DonorConnect was founded with a simple yet powerful mission: to bridge the gap between blood donors and those in urgent need. We believe that no one should have to suffer or die due to a lack of available blood. Our platform provides a seamless, efficient way for altruistic individuals to register as donors and for hospitals, patients, and families to find them in critical situations.</p>
